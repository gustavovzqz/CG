This project aims to demonstrate a basic implementation of pixel rendering using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. The primary goal is to recreate fundamental features found in renowned graphics libraries like OpenGL and Vulkan. By using SDL's simple yet powerful functions, this project showcases the foundational concepts of rendering pixels on a screen.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library
- C/C++ compiler

## Getting Started

This project is an example implementation of pixel rendering using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. To compile the project, navigate to the directories and use the CMake provided within the project.

You can left click in an object to use the "pick" function and right click on the screen to interact with the environment.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the need to understand the fundamental concepts behind popular graphics libraries like OpenGL and Vulkan. Special thanks to the SDL community for providing a simple and effective framework for multimedia applications.
